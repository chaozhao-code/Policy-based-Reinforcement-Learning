# Reinforcement Learning Assignment 3

### How to Reproduce Our Results

**Step 1**: Place all files in the same directory.

**Step 2**: Create two subdirectories `arrayResults` and `plotResults` within the directory where you placed the code files. These subdirectories are for storing results.

**Step 3**: Install the necessary packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 4**: To run experiments for Part 1: Algorithm Variation (Sections 3.1 and 3.2 in the report), use the following command:

```
python Experiment.py
```

**Step 5**: To run experiments for models comparison (Clip-PPO) and Part 2: Environment Variation (Sections 3.3 and 3.4 in the report), use the following command:

```
python Environment.py
```

**Step 6**: Check the results!

You should now find the generated plots in the `plotResults` folder, similar to those presented in our report.
